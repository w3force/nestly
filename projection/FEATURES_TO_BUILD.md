## Questions Before Starting?

1. **Order:** Should we prioritize Social Security/Medicare before completing What-If?
2. **Mobile Tiers:** Are any features restricted to paid tier on mobile?
3. **Export:** What formats should we support for exporting scenarios?
4. **Charts:** Any preference for charting library (Recharts, Chart.js, D3)?
5. **Offline:** Should web version work offline like mobile?
