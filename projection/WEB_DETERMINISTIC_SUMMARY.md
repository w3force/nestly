## 💡 Key Insights

### Why These Improvements Work

1. **Visual Hierarchy** - Users see what's most important
2. **Progress Feedback** - Users know where they are
3. **Validation Assurance** - Users feel confident in inputs
4. **Real-Time Results** - Users see impact immediately
5. **Accessibility** - Multiple input methods work for everyone
6. **Guidance** - Help is available without asking
7. **Preset Convenience** - Most users want quick defaults
8. **Professionalism** - Modern, polished experience

### The Underlying Principle

Transform from: **"A form I must fill"**  
Transform to: **"A planning tool that helps me"**

---

## 🎓 Design Philosophy

### Current Experience
- User focuses on completing form
- Fields seem disconnected
- Results appear only after calculation
- Help is hidden and optional
- No sense of progress

### Proposed Experience
- User focuses on understanding options
- Fields show relationships and impact
- Results update as they adjust
- Help is visible and contextual
- Clear progress through process

---

## 📱 Mobile Considerations

All improvements support mobile:
- Section cards stack vertically
- Sliders remain touch-friendly
- Presets become tap targets
- Help panels collapse efficiently
- Preview shows on same screen
- Validation provides clear feedback
