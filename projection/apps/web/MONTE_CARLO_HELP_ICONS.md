# Monte Carlo Help Icons Implementation

## ✅ What Was Added

Added help tooltips (?) to **all 11 Monte Carlo input fields** in the Calculator page.

### Complete List of MC Inputs with Help Icons:

#### Basic Inputs (same as Deterministic):
1. ✅ **Current Age** - Your age today
2. ✅ **Retirement Age** - When you plan to retire
3. ✅ **Current Balance ($)** - Starting 401(k)/IRA balance
4. ✅ **Annual Contribution ($)** - How much you save each year

#### Return & Risk Inputs:
5. ✅ **Expected Return (%)** - Average annual investment return
6. ✅ **Return Volatility (%)** - Standard deviation of returns (risk measure)
7. ✅ **Inflation (%)** - Annual inflation rate

#### Growth & Fees:
8. ✅ **Salary Growth (%)** - Annual salary increase (affects contributions)
9. ✅ **Annual Fee (%)** - Investment expense ratio

#### Monte Carlo Specific:
10. ✅ **# Paths** - Number of simulation scenarios to run
11. ✅ **Glidepath** - Switch with help icon explaining automatic risk reduction

## 📋 Implementation Pattern

### Consistent Help Icon Placement:

All fields now follow the same pattern as the Deterministic tab:

```tsx
<Grid item xs={6}>
  <Box sx={{ display: 'flex', alignItems: 'center', gap: 0.5, mb: 0.5 }}>
    <Typography variant="caption" sx={{ color: 'text.secondary' }}>
      Return Volatility (%)
    </Typography>
    <HelpTooltip
      title={helpContent.monteCarloInputs.returnVolatility.title}
      description={helpContent.monteCarloInputs.returnVolatility.description}
    />
  </Box>
  <TextField
    type="number"
    value={mcInput.return_volatility != null ? mcInput.return_volatility * 100 : ""}
    onChange={handleMonteCarloNumberChange("return_volatility", (value) => value / 100)}
    fullWidth
    disabled={!tierFeatures.hasMonteCarlo}
    inputProps={{ min: 0, max: 100, step: 0.01 }}
    sx={inputFieldStyles}
  />
</Grid>
```

### Before:
```tsx
<TextField label="Return Volatility (%)" ... />
```

### After:
```tsx
<Box>
  <Typography>Return Volatility (%)</Typography>
  <HelpTooltip ... />
</Box>
<TextField ... />
```

## 📚 Help Content Provided

### Basic Inputs:
- **Current Age**: "Your age today. The earlier you start, the more time for compound growth to work its magic."
- **Retirement Age**: "When you plan to stop working. Earlier = less time to save. Later = more contributions + growth."
- **Current Balance**: "How much you have saved today in 401(k)/IRA. This is your starting point."
- **Annual Contribution**: "How much you save each year. Higher contributions = bigger retirement nest egg."

### Return & Risk:
- **Expected Return**: "Average annual growth rate. Conservative: 5-6%, Balanced: 7-8%, Aggressive: 9-10%."
- **Return Volatility**: "Standard deviation of returns. Stocks: 15-20%, Bonds: 3-5%, Balanced: 10-12%. Higher volatility = more uncertainty."
- **Inflation**: "How much purchasing power declines each year. Historical average: 2-3%. High inflation erodes your savings."

### Growth & Fees:
- **Salary Growth**: "Annual salary increase (affects future contributions). Typical: 2-4%."
- **Annual Fee**: "Total expense ratio of your investments. Index funds: 0.03-0.20%, Actively managed: 0.5-1.5%. Lower fees = more money for you."

### Monte Carlo Specific:
- **# Paths**: "How many scenarios to run. More paths = more accurate results but slower. 1,000-5,000 is typical."
- **Glidepath**: "Automatically reduce risk as you age by shifting from stocks to bonds. Recommended for most retirement savers."

## 🎯 Why This Matters

### Before:
- ❌ Monte Carlo tab had **no help icons**
- ❌ Users had to guess what "Return Volatility" means
- ❌ No guidance on typical values (e.g., "Is 15% volatility normal?")
- ❌ Inconsistent UX between Deterministic and MC tabs
- ❌ Glidepath switch had no explanation

### After:
- ✅ **All 11 inputs** have help tooltips
- ✅ Hover to learn what each field means
- ✅ Typical ranges provided (e.g., "Stocks: 15-20%")
- ✅ **Consistent UX** across both tabs
- ✅ Glidepath switch has inline help tooltip

---

## 🔍 User Experience Flow

### Discovery:
1. User switches to Monte Carlo tab
2. Sees unfamiliar term like "Return Volatility"
3. Notices help icon (?) next to label
4. Hovers to get instant explanation
5. Learns typical range (15-20% for stocks)
6. Confidently enters a value

### Glidepath Feature:
```tsx
<Grid item xs={12} display="flex" alignItems="center">
  <Switch checked={!!mcInput.glidepath} ... />
  <Box sx={{ display: 'flex', alignItems: 'center', gap: 0.5 }}>
    <Typography variant="body2">
      Glidepath (reduce risk as you age)
    </Typography>
    <HelpTooltip
      title={helpContent.monteCarloInputs.glidepath.title}
      description={helpContent.monteCarloInputs.glidepath.description}
      size="small"
    />
  </Box>
</Grid>
```

Now the glidepath switch has:
- Clear label with description in parentheses
- Help icon explaining the strategy
- Small size to fit inline with text

## 📊 Coverage Summary

### Deterministic Tab:
- ✅ 6 input fields with help icons
- ✅ 2 gradient sliders (Return, Inflation)
- ✅ Result cards with tooltips

### Monte Carlo Tab:
- ✅ 11 input fields with help icons
- ✅ 1 switch with help icon (Glidepath)
- ✅ Result cards with tooltips (already had these)

### What-If Page:
- ✅ 5 sliders with help icons
- ✅ 2 gradient sliders (Return, Inflation)
- ✅ Editable scenario names

---

## 💡 Help Content Strategy

### Educational Focus:
- **What it means**: Clear definition in plain language
- **Why it matters**: Impact on retirement planning
- **Typical ranges**: Real-world examples (e.g., "Index funds: 0.03-0.20%")
- **Recommendations**: "Recommended for most retirement savers"

### Progressive Disclosure:
- **Title**: Concise (2-4 words) - appears first
- **Description**: 1-2 sentences with examples
- **No jargon**: "Standard deviation" → "measure of uncertainty"

---

## 🎨 Visual Design

### Help Icon Styling:
- **Icon**: `HelpOutlineIcon` from MUI
- **Size**: Small (for inline text like Glidepath)
- **Color**: Inherits text color
- **Hover**: Green tint (#69B47A) on hover
- **Placement**: Right of label, left of value

### Tooltip Styling:
- **Max width**: 300px (prevents overwhelming text blocks)
- **Arrow**: Points to help icon
- **Background**: Dark with white text (MUI default)
- **Delay**: Instant on hover
- **Bold title**: Makes content scannable

---

## 🚀 Impact

### User Benefits:
- **Learn Monte Carlo**: Understand advanced concepts without leaving the page
- **Make informed choices**: Know typical ranges before entering values
- **Reduce errors**: Help prevents unrealistic inputs (e.g., 50% volatility)
- **Build confidence**: Explanations empower users to experiment

### Product Benefits:
- **Reduced support**: Users self-serve instead of asking "What's volatility?"
- **Higher engagement**: Confident users run more simulations
- **Professional polish**: Shows attention to UX detail
- **Educational value**: Not just a calculator, but a learning tool

## 📝 Technical Notes

### Help Content Keys Used:
```typescript
// Shared with Deterministic
helpContent.calculator.currentAge
helpContent.calculator.retirementAge
helpContent.calculator.currentBalance
helpContent.calculator.annualContribution
helpContent.calculator.expectedReturn
helpContent.calculator.inflation
helpContent.calculator.salaryGrowth

// MC-specific
helpContent.monteCarloInputs.returnVolatility
helpContent.monteCarloInputs.annualFee
helpContent.monteCarloInputs.numPaths
helpContent.monteCarloInputs.glidepath
```

### Pattern Applied:
All TextField components converted from:
```tsx
<TextField label="Field Name" />
```

To:
```tsx
<Box>
  <Typography>Field Name</Typography>
  <HelpTooltip title="..." description="..." />
</Box>
<TextField /> {/* no label prop */}
```

This ensures help icons appear next to all input labels consistently.
