## File Structure
```
apps/mobile/
├── App.tsx (✅ Updated with NavigationContainer)
├── navigation/
│   └── BottomTabNavigator.tsx (✅ NEW - 4 tabs)
├── screens/
│   ├── HomeScreen.tsx (✅ NEW)
│   ├── CalculatorScreen.tsx (✅ NEW - 3 sub-tabs)
│   ├── MonteCarloTab.tsx (✅ NEW - copied from calculator.tsx)
│   ├── SSHealthcareTab.tsx (✅ NEW - placeholder)
│   ├── AssumptionsTab.tsx (✅ NEW - placeholder)
│   ├── WhatIfScreen.tsx (✅ NEW - placeholder)
│   └── ProfileScreen.tsx (✅ NEW - placeholder)
└── app/
    └── calculator.tsx (⚠️ Keep for reference, using MonteCarloTab now)
```

## Navigation Flow
```
App Root
└── NavigationContainer
    └── BottomTabNavigator
        ├── Home Tab → HomeScreen
        ├── Calculator Tab → CalculatorScreen
        │   └── TabView
        │       ├── Monte Carlo → MonteCarloTab
        │       ├── SS & Healthcare → SSHealthcareTab (Phase 3)
        │       └── Assumptions → AssumptionsTab
        ├── What-If Tab → WhatIfScreen (Phase 4)
        └── Profile Tab → ProfileScreen (Phase 8)
```

## Theme Consistency
All screens use the same theme as web:
- **Primary**: `#69B47A` (green)
- **Secondary**: `#4ABDAC` (teal)
- **Background**: `#F5F5F5` (light gray)
- **Surface**: `#FFFFFF` (white)
- **Text**: `#30403A` (dark green)

## Testing
1. App should compile without errors
2. Navigation tabs should be visible at bottom
3. Tapping tabs should switch between screens
4. Calculator tab should show 3 sub-tabs
5. Monte Carlo tab should be functional (existing calculator)
6. Other tabs show placeholder content

## Next Steps: Phase 3 - SS & Healthcare Mobile UI
Now ready to implement the full SS & Healthcare calculator:
1. Create `features/retirement/ss-healthcare/` folder structure
2. Build QuickForm.tsx using React Native Paper
3. Build DetailedForm.tsx with Paper Accordions
4. Build ResultsPanel.tsx with calculation display
5. Build NetByClaimAgeChart.tsx with VictoryChart
6. Import all calculations from `@projection/shared`
7. Implement mode switching (Quick ↔ Detailed)

## Code Sharing Progress
- **Phase 1**: Shared package with 100% of SS & Healthcare business logic ✅
- **Phase 2**: Navigation structure ready for all features ✅
- **Phase 3**: Will implement SS & Healthcare UI importing from shared (60-70% code reuse)

## Estimated Timeline
- Phase 2: ✅ Complete (0.5 days)
- Phase 3: 2-3 days (next)
- Total remaining: 8-13 days

---

**Status**: Phase 2 complete! Mobile app now has full navigation structure matching web app. Ready to implement SS & Healthcare calculator in Phase 3.
