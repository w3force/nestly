# Phase 3.2 Complete: SS & Healthcare Detailed Mode + Chart 🎉

**Date:** Phase 3.2 Completion  
**Status:** ✅ Ready for Testing

---

## 🎯 Objective

Extend the SS & Healthcare calculator on mobile with **Detailed Mode**, enabling users to:
- Input comprehensive information (35-year earnings history or AIME)
- Customize Medicare plan options and premium overrides
- Visualize net benefits across different claim ages with interactive chart
- Switch between Quick and Detailed modes seamlessly with data migration

---

## 📦 What Was Built

### 1. **DetailedForm.tsx** (~420 lines)
**Location:** `apps/mobile/features/retirement/ss-healthcare/DetailedForm.tsx`

Comprehensive input form with **4 collapsible accordion sections** using React Native Paper:

#### **Section 1: Basic Information**
- **Birth Year** (TextInput): Year born with FRA display
- **Claim Age** (Picker): Ages 62-70 dropdown
- **Filing Status** (Picker): Single or Married Filing Jointly

#### **Section 2: Earnings History**
- **Toggle Switch**: Use AIME directly OR input 35-year earnings
- **AIME Input** (when toggled ON): Single dollar input from SSA.gov
- **35-Year History** (when toggled OFF): 
  - ScrollView with 35 year rows (current year back 35 years)
  - Each year has TextInput for annual earnings
  - Pre-fills any existing earnings history data
  - Nested scrolling enabled for smooth UX

#### **Section 3: Medicare & Medicaid**
- **MAGI Input**: Modified Adjusted Gross Income for IRMAA calculations
- **State Picker**: All 50 states + DC for Medicaid eligibility
- **Plan Type**: SegmentedButtons for Original Medicare vs Medicare Advantage
- **Part A Coverage**: Switch with helper text about $505/month premium

#### **Section 4: Premium Overrides (Optional)**
- **Conditional fields based on plan type:**
  - **Original Medicare**: Part D Premium, Medigap Premium inputs
  - **Medicare Advantage**: Advantage Premium input
- **Employer/HSA Offset**: Monthly healthcare offset amount
- All overrides are optional with defaults from 2025 national averages

**Key Features:**
- All inputs import `DetailedModeInputs` from `@projection/shared`
- Uses `getFRA()` to show Full Retirement Age dynamically
- `US_STATES` config from shared package for state dropdown
- Helper text on every input explaining what it does
- Accordion sections for organized, scannable UI
- Styled with React Native Paper theme colors

---

### 2. **NetByClaimAgeChart.tsx** (~220 lines)
**Location:** `apps/mobile/features/retirement/ss-healthcare/NetByClaimAgeChart.tsx`

Interactive chart using **Victory Native** to visualize benefit optimization:

#### **Chart Elements:**
- **X-Axis**: Claim ages 62-70 (labeled, gridlines)
- **Y-Axis**: Monthly benefit in dollars (formatted as $Xk)
- **Solid Line (Teal #4ABDAC)**: Social Security monthly benefit
- **Dashed Line (Green #69B47A)**: Net benefit after Medicare costs
- **Red Dot Highlight (#FF6B6B)**: Currently selected claim age

#### **Data Visualization:**
- Uses `ClaimAgeSweepPoint[]` from `@projection/shared`
- Auto-calculates Y-axis domain with 10% padding
- Responsive width adapts to screen size
- Material theme with grid lines for readability

#### **Interactive Legend:**
- Shows line meanings (SS, Net, Selected)
- Displays selected age's net monthly value with currency formatting
- Bottom-aligned for easy reading

#### **States:**
- **Loading**: ActivityIndicator with "Computing..." message
- **Empty**: Instruction text when no data available
- **Rendered**: Full chart with all data points and highlighting

---

### 3. **SSHealthcareTab.tsx Updates** (~190 lines total)
**Location:** `apps/mobile/features/retirement/ss-healthcare/SSHealthcareTab.tsx`

Enhanced controller to support both modes:

#### **New Imports:**
- `DetailedForm` component
- `NetByClaimAgeChart` component
- `ClaimAgeSweepPoint` type for chart data

#### **New State:**
- `claimAgeSweep`: Array of claim age sweep data for chart visualization
- Stores results from `computeSSHealthcareResults().sweep`

#### **Mode Switching Enhanced:**
- **Removed disabled flag** from Detailed button
- Quick ↔ Detailed switching with data migration:
  - Quick → Detailed: Uses `quickToDetailed()` from shared
  - Detailed → Quick: Preserves birthYear, claimAge, MAGI, stateCode

#### **Compute Logic Updated:**
- Stores `sweep` array from results for chart rendering
- Sweep data computed automatically by `computeSSHealthcareResults()`
- Works for both Quick and Detailed modes

#### **Rendering Updates:**
- Conditional rendering: `QuickForm` OR `DetailedForm`
- Chart renders below results **only in Detailed mode**
- Chart shows when `claimAgeSweep.length > 0`
- Passes `detailedInputs.claimAge` to highlight selected age

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Architecture
```
SSHealthcareTab (Controller)
├── SegmentedButtons (Quick / Detailed)
├── ScrollView
│   ├── QuickForm (if mode='QUICK')
│   ├── DetailedForm (if mode='DETAILED')
│   │   └── 4 Accordion Sections
│   │       ├── List.Accordion (Basic Info)
│   │       ├── List.Accordion (Earnings History)
│   │       ├── List.Accordion (Medicare & Medicaid)
│   │       └── List.Accordion (Premium Overrides)
│   ├── Compute Button
│   ├── SSResultsPanel (Results Display)
│   └── NetByClaimAgeChart (if mode='DETAILED' && data exists)
└── Snackbar (Notifications)
```

### Code Sharing Achievement
- **0 lines** of business logic duplicated
- **100%** calculation logic from `@projection/shared`:
  - `computeSSHealthcareResults()` handles both modes
  - Returns `sweep` array for chart automatically
  - Types: `DetailedModeInputs`, `SSHealthcareResults`, `ClaimAgeSweepPoint`
  - Utils: `getFRA()`, `US_STATES` config
- **Mobile UI layer**: ~640 new lines (DetailedForm + Chart)
- **Shared calculations**: ~1,500 lines (reused from Phase 1)

### Dependencies
- **React Native Paper 5.14.5**: List.Accordion, SegmentedButtons, TextInput, Switch, Divider
- **@react-native-picker/picker**: Native dropdowns for Claim Age, Filing Status, State
- **Victory Native 36.9.2**: VictoryChart, VictoryLine, VictoryAxis, VictoryScatter
- **@projection/shared**: All business logic, types, calculations, config

### Key Design Decisions

1. **Accordion Sections**: Reduces visual overload, users expand only what they need
2. **Earnings History Scrolling**: Nested ScrollView for 35 inputs without breaking parent
3. **AIME Toggle**: Most users don't have full earnings history, toggle provides shortcut
4. **Conditional Overrides**: Only show relevant premium fields based on plan type
5. **Chart in Detailed Only**: Quick mode users may not need visualization, reduces clutter
6. **Auto-computed Sweep**: Computation happens once, sweep data cached for chart

---

## 🐛 Known Issues & Limitations

### Current Limitations
1. **CSV Upload**: "Upload CSV" button is a placeholder (Phase 4 feature)
2. **Dashed Line**: React Native doesn't support CSS dashes, so "dashed" line is slightly transparent solid
3. **Accordion memory**: Opening an accordion closes others (one open at a time)
4. **Earnings history scroll**: Requires nested scrolling flag, may feel different on some devices

### Non-Issues (Working as Designed)
- Chart only shows in Detailed mode (intentional - Quick users don't need it)
- Sweep data computed even in Quick mode (efficient - data already available)
- AIME toggle doesn't auto-migrate earnings → AIME (user must re-enter)
