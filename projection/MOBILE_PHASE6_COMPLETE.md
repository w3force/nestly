## Performance Considerations

### Help Content Loading
- ✅ All 25+ topics embedded in app bundle (no API calls)
- ✅ Content loaded once on app start
- ✅ `getHelpTopic()` is O(1) lookup in dictionary
- ✅ No performance impact on screen render

### Modal Rendering
- ✅ Portal used for modal overlay (efficient DOM management)
- ✅ Modal only renders when visible (not mounted until tap)
- ✅ ScrollView for long content (smooth scrolling)
- ✅ No re-renders of parent screen when modal opens

### Memory Usage
- ✅ Help content: ~50KB (650 lines of text)
- ✅ Component overhead: Minimal (3 small components)
- ✅ No memory leaks (modals clean up on dismiss)

### Bundle Size Impact
- ✅ Help content adds ~50KB to shared package
- ✅ Components add ~10KB to mobile bundle
- ✅ Total Phase 6 impact: ~60KB (0.06% of typical app)

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well

1. **Shared Content First**
   - Building help content in shared package enables web reuse
   - Single source of truth for educational content
   - Easy to update content in one place

2. **Rich Topic Structure**
   - Title + short + full description provides flexibility
   - Examples make concepts concrete
   - Related topics encourage exploration

3. **Minimal UI Interruption**
   - Help icons use neutral colors (don't distract)
   - Modals overlay (don't navigate away)
   - "Got it!" button provides clear exit

4. **Contextual Placement**
   - Help next to input = immediate relevance
   - Help in section headers = overview context
   - Help on results = interpretation guidance

5. **Consistent Pattern**
   - `inputWithHelp` style used everywhere
   - Same icon size (20px) for consistency
   - Same modal layout across all topics

### Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge 1**: Help icons making UI cluttered  
**Solution**: Used outline style and neutral gray color to minimize visual weight. Icons blend into design while remaining accessible.

**Challenge 2**: Long help content hard to read in modal  
**Solution**: Added ScrollView, increased line height, used clear typography hierarchy (title → short → full → examples).

**Challenge 3**: Users might not discover help icons  
**Solution**: Positioned icons prominently next to confusing terms. Future: Consider one-time tooltips or onboarding flow highlighting help.

**Challenge 4**: Maintaining help content as app evolves  
**Solution**: Centralized all content in `helpContent.ts`. TypeScript interfaces enforce structure. Related topics enable content network.

**Challenge 5**: Different help needs for Quick vs Detailed modes  
**Solution**: Same help icons in both, but content adapts. QuickForm gets beginner-friendly topics, DetailedForm gets advanced topics.

### Best Practices for Future Help Content

1. **Write for Beginners**: Assume no financial knowledge. Explain jargon.
2. **Use Examples**: Concrete numbers are more helpful than abstract descriptions.
3. **Keep It Scannable**: Break into short paragraphs. Use bullet lists.
4. **Cross-Reference**: Link related topics to encourage learning paths.
5. **Test with Users**: Ask non-experts to read help and attempt tasks.
6. **Update Regularly**: Financial rules change (e.g., IRMAA brackets, FRA). Keep content current.
7. **Measure Usage**: Track which help topics are opened most. Improve those first.
