# 📋 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY - UI Schema Implementation

## Problem We Solved

**Before:** Web and mobile applications constantly diverge, losing context and requiring duplicate work:
- Field ranges defined differently on each platform
- Help text manually synced (often out of sync)
- Validation logic repeated 
- Colors hard to keep consistent
- New developers had to understand two codebases

**After:** Single unified schema that both platforms consume:
- All constraints defined once, used by both
- Validation rules centralized and enforced
- Color schemes consistent everywhere
- Help content managed in one place
- New developers read schema, not code

---

## What We Built

### 📦 Unified UI Schema Layer (`@projection/shared/src/uiSchema/`)

6 files, 1,031 lines of centralized definitions:

| File | Purpose | Lines |
|------|---------|-------|
| `types.ts` | Core type definitions | 150 |
| `validation.ts` | Validation rule builders | 110 |
| `categories.ts` | Color mappings & categories | 165 |
| `inputFields.ts` | 7 field definitions | 290 |
| `screens.ts` | 4 screen definitions | 310 |
| `index.ts` | Export all definitions | 6 |
| **TOTAL** | **Centralized schema** | **1,031** |

---

## What's Defined

### ✅ 7 Input Fields
```
Age → Constraints, validation, help, formatting
Retirement Age → Constraints, validation, help, formatting
Current Balance → Currency formatting, validation
Annual Contribution → Dynamic max (age-based 50+ catch-up)
Contribution Rate → Percentage formatting
Expected Return → Color-coded 0-15%
Inflation → Color-coded 0-6% (inverse logic)
```

### ✅ 3 Color Systems
```
Expected Return: Low (Red) | Average (Orange) | High (Green)
Inflation: Good (Green) | Normal (Orange) | High Risk (Red)
Contribution: Conservative | Moderate | Aggressive
```

### ✅ 4 Screen Definitions
```
Landing Page → Feature cards, navigation
Deterministic → Single scenario calculator
What-If → Multiple scenario comparison
Monte Carlo → Probability analysis (10k sims)
```

### ✅ Validation System
```
Reusable rules: Required, Min, Max, Decimal, Pattern, Custom
Validation functions: validateField(), validateForm()
Cross-field validation: age < retirement age, etc.
```

---

## How It Works

### Before (❌ Duplicated)
```typescript
// Mobile: DeterministicTab.tsx
<Slider max={age >= 50 ? 30500 : 23500} />

// Web: DeterministicForm.tsx  
<Slider max={age >= 50 ? 30500 : 23500} />
// ^ Same code, twice!
```

### After (✅ Unified)
```typescript
// Both Mobile and Web
import { FIELD_DEFINITIONS } from '@projection/shared';

const fieldDef = FIELD_DEFINITIONS['contribution'];
const max = fieldDef.constraints.conditionalMax?.({ age }) 
  || fieldDef.constraints.max;

<Slider max={max} />
// ^ Defined once, used by both
```

## Key Guarantees

| Aspect | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Field Ranges | Different on each | **Same everywhere** |
| Validation | Repeated logic | **One source of truth** |
| Colors | Manual sync | **Central palette** |
| Help Text | Might diverge | **Unified** |
| New Features | 2x work | **1x definition + 2x UI** |
| Context Loss | Frequent | **Eliminated** |

## Features Ready to Build

### 🔴 Phase 1 (Week 1-2) - HIGH PRIORITY
1. **Landing Page** - Schema ✅, Ready to build
2. **Deterministic** - Schema ✅, Mobile partial, Web to build
3. **What-If** - Schema ✅, Mobile partial, Web to build

### 🟡 Phase 2 (Week 3-4) - HIGH PRIORITY
4. **Monte Carlo** - Schema ✅, Mobile done, Web to build

### 🟡 Phase 3 (Week 4-5) - MEDIUM PRIORITY
5. **Social Security** - Schema needed, then build
6. **Medicare** - Schema needed, then build

### 🟢 Phase 4 (Week 5+) - LOW PRIORITY
7. **Profile/Settings** - Schema needed, then build

## Status

### ✅ Complete
- Schema infrastructure (types, validation, categories)
- 7 field definitions (age, balance, return, inflation, etc.)
- 4 screen definitions (landing, deterministic, what-if, MC)
- 3 color mapping systems
- Validation rule builders
- All files compile without errors
- All exports working

### 🔄 Ready for Next Phase
- Landing page (web + mobile)
- Deterministic refactor (mobile) + build (web)
- What-If refactor (mobile) + build (web)
- Monte Carlo build (web)

### ⏳ To Schedule
- Social Security schema + implementation
- Medicare schema + implementation
- Profile/settings schema + implementation

## Impact

### ✅ Eliminates Context Loss
Developer doesn't need to hunt through two codebases. Everything is in the schema.

### ✅ Guarantees Feature Parity
Impossible for platforms to diverge on constraints, validation, or colors.

### ✅ Accelerates Development
New features: define in schema → both platforms get automatically.

### ✅ Simplifies Onboarding
New developer: read schema files, not entire codebase.

### ✅ Enables Testing
Schema is pure data → easy to unit test all constraints and logic.

## Next Steps

1. **Review** - Check schema files for completeness
2. **Ask Questions** - Any missing fields or constraints?
3. **Start Building** - Week 1: Landing page on web + mobile
4. **Refactor Mobile** - Week 2: Deterministic using field definitions
5. **Build Web** - Week 2-3: Deterministic web version
6. **Scale** - Repeat for What-If, Monte Carlo

## TL;DR

**Problem:** Web and mobile constantly diverge  
**Solution:** Centralized UI schema in `@projection/shared`  
**Result:** Single source of truth for all UI definitions  
**Status:** ✅ Complete, ready to use  
**Timeline:** 4-6 weeks to build all features with guaranteed parity  
**Next:** Build landing page (week 1), then deterministic/what-if/MC (weeks 2-4)
