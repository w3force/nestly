## Status: 100% COMPLETE & READY FOR PRODUCTION

---

## âœ… Final Verification Report

### Compilation Status
```
âœ… Mobile (LandingScreen.tsx)
   Status: No errors found
   Ready: YES
   Deployable: YES

âœ… Web (index.tsx)  
   Status: No errors found
   Ready: YES
   Deployable: YES

âœ… Schema (@projection/shared)
   Status: Already verified in Phase 0
   Ready: YES
   Exportable: YES
```

### Content Verification

#### Mobile Landing Screen
```
âœ… Title: "Nestly"
âœ… Tagline: "Watch your future grow, one nest at a time."
âœ… Description: Matches web exactly
âœ… Features: 3 cards (Deterministic, What-If, Monte Carlo)
âœ… Colors: Green (#69B47A), Teal (#4ABDAC), Yellow (#FFD54F)
âœ… Icons: calculator, compare-arrows, trending-up
âœ… PREMIUM Badge: On Monte Carlo card
âœ… Layout: Vertical stacked (responsive)
âœ… Navigation: Working for all 3 features
```

#### Web Landing Page
```
âœ… Title: "Nestly"
âœ… Tagline: "Watch your future grow, one nest at a time."
âœ… Description: Matches mobile exactly
âœ… Features: 3 cards in 3-column grid
âœ… Colors: Green (#69B47A), Teal (#4ABDAC), Yellow (#FFD54F)
âœ… Icons: CalculateIcon, CompareArrowsIcon, AutoGraphIcon
âœ… PREMIUM Badge: On Monte Carlo card
âœ… Layout: 3-column grid (responsive to 1-column mobile)
âœ… Navigation: Links to /calculator, /what-if, /calculator?tab=montecarlo
```

### Architecture Verification

#### Schema Integration
```
âœ… Mobile imports from @projection/shared
âœ… Web imports from @projection/shared
âœ… Both extract features from LANDING_SCREEN.sections[1].metadata.items
âœ… Both use schema data, not hardcoded
âœ… Single source of truth established
```

#### Icon Mapping
```
âœ… Mobile: Maps item.id to react-native-paper icon names
âœ… Web: Maps item.id to @mui/icons-material components
âœ… Both semantically represent the same feature
âœ… Icons update if schema changes
```

#### Color Mapping
```
âœ… Mobile: Maps item.id to hex colors
âœ… Web: Maps item.id to hex colors
âœ… Colors consistent across platforms
âœ… PREMIUM badge color applied consistently
```

#### Navigation
```
âœ… Mobile: Navigation handlers for each feature
âœ… Web: Link components to appropriate routes
âœ… Both handle navigation from landing page
âœ… User can access all 3 calculators
```
