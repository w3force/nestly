## Key Concepts

### Single Source of Truth
```
Schema (LANDING_SCREEN)
├─ Features list
├─ Colors
├─ Icons (semantic)
└─ Content

Both platforms extract this data
and render it platform-specifically
```

### Platform-Specific Mapping
```
Mobile:
  Icon name → react-native-paper Icon component
  Color → Applied to Paper components
  Layout → Vertical stacking

Web:
  Icon name → MUI Icon component
  Color → Applied to MUI components
  Layout → Grid layout
```

### Data Flow
```
1. Import LANDING_SCREEN from schema
2. Extract features from metadata
3. Map features to platform components
4. Render with platform-specific styling
5. Both show identical content
```

- Web: Build new Deterministic page using FIELD_DEFINITIONS
- Result: Perfect parity with zero duplication

Expected outcome:
- Same validation on both platforms
- Same colors on both platforms
- Same field constraints on both platforms
- Identical behavior, different layout

Documentation will follow same pattern:
- CODE_FLOW showing step-by-step implementation
- IMPLEMENTATION guide with details
- DEPLOYMENT_READY for production
- CHECKLIST updates
