## Technical Implementation

### Architecture
```
Landing → Start → Auth → [Main App]
           ↑       ↑
    AsyncStorage tracking onboarding status
    
Main App Structure:
- Home: Landing/welcome content
- Calculate: Monte Carlo & SS/Healthcare tabs
- What-If: Scenario analysis
- Profile: User settings & tier badge
```

### Onboarding Flow
1. **First Time Users**:
   - LandingScreen (value prop)
   - StartScreen (tier selection)
   - AuthScreen (create account)
   - → Main App

2. **Returning Users**:
   - Check AsyncStorage for `@nestly_onboarding_complete`
   - Skip onboarding
   - → Main App directly
